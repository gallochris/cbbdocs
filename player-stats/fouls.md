# Fouls

There are 3 metrics that indicate how fouls factor into an individual's effectiveness:

1. Free Throw Rate \(FTRate\)
2. Fouls committed per 40 minutes played \(FC/40\)
3. Fouls drawn per 40 minutes played \(FD/40\)

### Free Throw Rate \(FTRate\)

Free throw rate measures a player's ability to get to the foul line relative to how often he attempts to score. It takes a players free throw attempts and divides those attempts by the player's total field goal attempts.

`FTRate = 100 * FTA / FGA`

For example, PJ Washington of Kentucky had a free throw rate was 80.3 in the 2017-2018 season. This ranked 3rd amongst all Division-I players.

Washington attempted 208 free throws and 259 field goals.

`FTRate = 100 * 208 / 259 = 80.3`

### Fouls committed per 40 minutes played FC/40

This is a straight-forward stat that shows the amount of fouls a player commits per 40 minutes played.

`FC/40 = (Fouls committed / MP) * 40`

For example, Quentin Snider of Louisville committed 1.32 fouls per 40 minutes in 2017-2018. This was 12th in the country.

Snider committed 38 fouls playing in 1155 minutes over the season.

`FC/40 = (38 / 1155) * 40 = 1.32`

### Fouls drawn per 40 minutes played \(FD/40\)

This is a stat developed by [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) and explained more on [this page](http://kenpom.com/blog/help-with-team-page/). It makes several assumptions from Division-I averages, [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) details below:

* each shooting foul results in an average of 1.8 free throws
* 16.3% of all fouls are committed by the offense
* no offensive foul results in a shot \(this is not entirely true since some offensive fouls occur in rebounding situations\)
* players on defense draw fouls at equal rates
* players on offense draw non-shooting fouls proportional to their percentage of possessions used

Applying all of these assumptions can give a fair estimate of a player's fouls drawn.

For example, Collin Sexton of Alabama drew 7.6 fouls per 40 minutes played in 2017-2018. This ranked 7th in the nation.

Sexton played in 987 minutes in the 2017-2018 season drawing about 188 fouls.

`FD/40 = (188 / 987) * 40 = 7.6`
