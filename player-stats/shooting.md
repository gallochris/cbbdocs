# Shooting

We'll look at 3 calculations here to measure a player's ability to shoot:

1. %Shots
2. eFG%
3. TS%

### Percentage of shots taken

When a player is on the court, how many shots does the player attempt compared the rest of the team?

A percentage of shots taken is measured by taking a players' field goal attempts divided by its percentage of minutes played multiplied by its team's field goal attempts.

`%Shots = Player's FGA / (%Min * TeamFGA)`

For example, Wisconsin's Ethan Happ took 33.7% of his team's shots in 2017-2018 season. This ranked 19th amongst all Division-I players.

Happ attempted 458 of his team's 1770 shots and played in 76.8% minutes over the year.

`%Shots = 458 / .768 x 1770 = 33.69`

A percentage of shots a player has taken is a good indication of [possessions used](../efficiency/possessions.md).

### Effective Field Goal Percentage

The exact calculation used for teams here is also applied to individuals. As a reminder, effective field goal percentage accounts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth more than a two-point field goal.

`eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA`

For example, Mikal Bridges of Villanova had an eFG% was 62.3% in the 2017-2018 season. This was 48th in the country.

104 of Bridge's 244 made field goals were from behind 3-point line, and he attempted 475 total shots.

`eFG% = (.5 * 104 + 244) / 475 = 0.623 * 100`

### True Shooting Percentage

True shooting percentage is used to more accurately define a player's ability to shoot. It incorporates field goal percentage, field goal attempts, and free throw attempts.

It uses the same multiplier \(.475\) that is used when calculating efficiency. The multiplier estimates how many free throw attempts equal one possession.

`TS% = Points scored / ( 2* (FGA + 0.475 * FTA) )`

For example, William & Mary's Connor Burchfield posted a true shooting percentage of 71% in the 2017-2018 season. This is good for 1st in the country.

Burchfield scored 390 points, attempted 248 field goals and 40 free throws.

`TS% = 390 / (2 * (248 + 0.475 * 40) ) = 0.709 * 100`
