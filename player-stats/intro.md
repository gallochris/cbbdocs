# Intro to Player Stats

The same way [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) rates teams, players can also be evaluated.

In this section, you'll find the different stats that go into assessing an individual player.

* [Minutes played and possessions used](minutes-played.md)
* [Offensive rating \(ORtg\)](offensive-ratings.md)
* [Shooting \(%Shots, eFG%, & TS%\)](shooting.md)
* [Rebounding percentages \(OR% & DR%\)](rebounding.md)
* [Assists and Turnovers](assists-and-turnovers.md)
* [Blocks & Steals](blocks-and-steals.md)
* [Fouls](fouls.md)
