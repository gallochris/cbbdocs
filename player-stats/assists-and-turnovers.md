# Assists & Turnovers

An individual player's ability to distribute the ball and avoid turnovers is measured by 2 stats.

1. Assist Rate
2. Turnover Rate

### Assist Rate

A player's assist rate is computed by taking a player's total assists divided by the made field goals by the player's teammates while the player is on the court.

Here is the calculation:

`ARate = 100 * AST / (((MP / (Team's MP / 5)) * Team's FG) - FG)`

For example, Oklahoma's Trae Young posted an assist rate of 48.5 in the 2017-2018 season. This was good for 1st in the country.

Young had 278 assists in 1133 minutes played compared to his team's 1285 total minutes. Oklahoma made 954 field goals to Young's 261 field goals.

`ARate = 100 * 278 / (((1133 / (1285 / 5)) * 954) - 261) = 0.485 * 100`

### Turnover Rate

Turnover rate is the percentage of a player's possessions used on turnovers. It's complicated to measure and explain for individual players.

Remember when assessing a team's turnover rate, you take the percentage of possessions that end in a turnover.

For an individual player, turnover rate uses _personal possessions_. This means context is important. Players that don't handle the ball often or at all will have a deflated turnover rate. A guard who constantly has the ball will likely have a higher turnover rate.

For example, Wichita State's Conner Frankamp posted a 5.1 turnover rate in 2017-2018. This was rated 2nd amongst all Division-I players.

Around 5 percent of Frankamp's personal possessions ended in a turnover.
