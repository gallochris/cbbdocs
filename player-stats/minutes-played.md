# Minutes Played

Minutes played measures how often a player is on the floor per game. This stat doesn't factor in overtime games, so it can be a bit misleading.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) uses a percentage of possible minutes played to account for overtime periods.

`(%Min) = Minutes played / Possible Amount of Minutes`

In the 2017-2018 season, Tyus Battle of Syracuse played in 96.2% of all minutes. This was good for 1st in the country.

Battle played 1443 total minutes of a possible 1500 minutes.

`%Min = 1443 / 1500 = 0.962 x 100`

**How does this compare to minutes per game?**

Syracuse played in 37 games in 2017-2018. Battle played a total of 39.0 minutes per game.

96.2% of 40 minutes is roughly 38.5 minutes per game.

**Why is the percentage of minutes slightly higher?**

Because Syracuse played 3 overtime games, including one double-overtime game. These games added 20 minutes to the possible minutes Battle could have played.

**What about injuries?**

This stat doesn't factor in injuries. It's impossible to predict and measure an injury. The total number of games played by the individual can give a better idea of how those minutes are spread out.

### Possessions Used

When a player is on the court, how involved is the player on the offensive end of the court?

The answer is a player's percentage of possessions used \(%Poss\). It's calculated by giving credit or blame to a player when their actions end a possession.

A few different ways a possession can end:

* making a shot \(credit\)
* missing a shot, rebounded by defense \(blame\)
* committing a turnover \(blame\)

`(%Poss) = Possessions Ended / Total Possessions`

Following the same example, Tyus Battle was used on 26.2% of Syracuse possessions in the 2017-2018 season.
