# Rebounding

An individual player's ability to rebound increases its team's possessions. There are 2 percentages used to measure a player's ability to grab rebounds.

1. Offensive rebounding percentage \(OR%\)
2. Defensive rebounding percentage \(DR%\)

### Offensive Rebounding Percentage

What is the percentage of offensive rebounds a player gets?

This is calculated by incorporating a player's total offensive rebounds, percentage of minutes played, a team's total offensive rebounds, and opponent's defensive rebounds.

`OR% = PlayerOR / [%Min * (Team OR + Opp. DR)]`

For example, Nick Ward of Michigan State posted an offensive rebounding percentage of 18.2%.

This ranked 1st in the nation in the 2017-2018 season.

Ward grabbed 94 offensive rebounds playing in 47.1% of his team's minutes. Michigan State snagged 401 total offensive rebounds and their opponent's grabbed 689 total defensive rebounds.

`OR% = 94 / [.471 * (401 + 689)] = 0.182 * 100`

### Defensive Rebounding Percentage

The same calculation is used to determine the percentage of defensive rebounds a player gets.

It incorporates a player's total defensive rebounds, percentage of minutes played, a team's total defensive rebounds, and an opponent's offensive rebounds.

`DR% = PlayerOR / [%Min * (Team DR + Opp. OR)]`

For example, New Mexico State's Jemerrio Jones had a defensive rebounding percentage of 37.3%.

This ranked 1st amongst all Division-I players in the 2017-2018 season.

Jones collected 323 defensive rebounds when he was on the court for 69.2% of his team's minutes. New Mexico State had 975 total defensive rebounds to their opponent's 282 offensive rebounds.

`OR% = 323 / [.692 * (975 + 282)] = 0.373 * 100`
