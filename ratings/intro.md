# Intro to Ratings

This section covers [KenPom ratings](http://kenpom.com/).

A team is rated based on its skill and opportunities. Or to put it more simply, a team is rated on its efficiency.

The ratings system is built on points scored or points allowed per possession.

[KenPom's](http://kenpom.com/) system is predictive. It's **not** meant to measure how _good_ a team's season is going. There are several polls all which have a mixed definition of what _good_ means.

This ratings system purpose is to indicate how a team would perform if it played today. It doesn't factor in injuries or emotions. These ratings give an idea of how a team's performing right now.

This section covers the different components that lead to a team's rating.
