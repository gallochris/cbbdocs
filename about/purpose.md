# Purpose

The goal of this site to help people learn more about advanced analytics for college basketball. 

None of the information on this site is _new_. You can find it all on [Kenpom.com](http://kenpom.com/) and other places on the web. This information is remixed and reshuffled to make it easier for you to digest.

The concepts listed on this site aren't right. They aren't wrong either. They're just there for you to draw your own conclusions or maybe consider a new perspective.

Please understand this site isn't perfect. If you find a typo or see bad math, or a wrong calculation, please [let me know](contact.md). While not perfect, I want this to be as accurate as possible.
