#### Who are you?

My name is [Chris Gallo](http://hotdogsandeggs.com/). I'm a former sports information director and now work in software. I put together this site because I was struggling to learn more about college basketball advanced analytics.

#### Are you affiliated with kenpom.com?

Nope. I subscribe to [Kenpom.com](http://kenpom.com/), and if you're interested in advanced analysis of college basketball, [you should too](http://kenpom.com/register.php) or check out other [resources](../resources/intro.md) too.

#### How can I help you?

Suggest how this site can improve, and do it in a thoughtful way. If you want to share this site with others, that would be cool too.

#### Where do the stats come from?

All the data in the examples is pulled from [Kenpom.com](http://kenpom.com/), [sports-reference.com](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/), or the NCAA.
