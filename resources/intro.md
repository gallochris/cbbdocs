# Intro to Resources

First, the ultimate resource here is [KenPom.com](http://kenpom.com/). A 12-month subscription is $19.95. It's 100% worth it.

In the rest of this section, you'll find the different resources that can help you learn more about college basketball advanced stats.

If you have a good resource that is not on this list, please [send it to me](../about/contact.md).
