# Stats Glossary

### Miscellaneous stats

**FG**: Field goals

**FGA**: Field goal attempts \(2 or 3-point shots\)

**FGM**: Field goal makes \(2 or 3-point made shots\)

**TO**: Turnovers

**FTA**: Free throw attempts

**FTM**: Free throw makes

**OR**: Offensive rebound

**DR**: Defensive rebound

**3PA**: 3-point shot attempts

**3PM**: 3-point shot makes

**2PA**: 2-point shot attempts

**2PM**: 2-point shot makes

**Team rebound**: A rebound that _doesn't_ fall into the possession of an individual player.

### Four Factors

**eFG%**: effective field goal percentage

`eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA * 100`

**TO%**: turnover percentage

`TO% = TO / Possessions`

**OR%**: team offensive rebounding percentage

`OR% = Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent's Defensive Rebounds)`

**FTRate**: Free throw rate

`FTRate = FTA / FGA`

### Efficiency

**Possessions**: how a team or player gains control of the ball

`Possessions = FGA - OR + TO + (.475 * FTA)`

**OE**: offensive efficiency

`OE = (Points scored * 100) / Possessions`

**DE**: defensive efficiency

`DE = (Points allowed * 100) / Possessions`

**Adjusted efficiency margin \(AdjEM\)**: the number of points a team would be expected to outscore the average Division-I team over 100 possessions without adjusting for location of the game

`AjdEM = OE - DE`

**Tempo/Pace**: number of possessions a team uses in a game

**AdjT**: adjusted tempo or the pace each team wants to play

`AdjT = Avg. Possessions adjusted by % increase/decrease of actual possessions`

**AdjO**: adjusted offensive efficiency for competition

**AdjD**: adjusted defensive efficiency for competition

**APL**: Average possession length

`APL = a team's seconds on offense and defense`

**Luck**: compares a team's record to what they deserved based on their game-by-game efficiency

`Luck = NORM (AdjO - AdjD) / SD(Rating Difference)`

**AdjEM of SOS**: overall strength of schedule of a team or difference between the average of its opponents' offensive and defensive efficiencies

`AdjEM of SOS = AdjO - AdjD`

**Tier A**: a game against a top-50 opponent adjusted for location of the game

**Tier B**: a game against a top-100 opponent adjusted for location of the game

### Player Stats

**%Min**: a player's minutes played

`(%Min) = Minutes played / Possible Amount of Minutes`

**%Poss**: a player's possessions used

`(%Poss) = Possessions Ended / Total Possessions`

**ORtg**: number of points produced by a player per hundred total individual possessions

`ORtg = (Points Produced / Total Possessions) x 100`

**%Shots**: percentage of team's shots taken by a player

`%Shots = Player's FGA / (%Min * TeamFGA)`

**TS%**: true shooting percentage

`TS% = Points scored / ( 2* (FGA + 0.475 * FTA) )`

**OR%**: offensive rebounding percentage of a player

`OR% = PlayerOR / [%Min * (Team OR + Opp. DR)]`

**DR%**: defensive rebounding percentage of a player

`DR% = PlayerOR / [%Min * (Team DR + Opp. OR)]`

**ARate**: assist rate of a player

`ARate = 100 * AST / (((MP / (Team's MP / 5)) * Team's FG) - FG)`

**TORate**: turnover rate of a player or percentage of a player's possessions used on turnovers

**%Blocks**: a player's block percentage

`%Blocks = Total Player's Blocks / (%Min * Opponents' 2-point attempts)`

**%Stls**: a player's steal percentage

`%Stls = 100 * Steals / (%Min * Team Possessions)`

**FTRate**: a player's free throw attempts divided by its field goal attempts

`FTRate = 100 * FTA / FGA`

**FC/40**: amount of fouls a player commits per 40 minutes

`FC/40 = (Fouls committed / MP) * 40`

**FD/40**: amount of fouls a player draws per 40 minutes

### Team Stats

**3P%**: a team's/opp.'s 3-point field goal percentage

`3P% = 3PM / 3PA * 100`

**2P%**: a team's/opp.'s 2-point field goal percentage

`2P% = 2PM / 2PA * 100`

**FT%**: a team's/opp.'s free throw percentage

`FT% = FTM / FTA * 100`

**Blk%**: a team's/opp.'s block percentage

`Blk% = Opp. blocks / 2PA * 100`

**St%**: a team's/opp.'s steal percentage

`Stls% = Opp. steals / Offensive Possessions`

**A%**: a team's/opp.'s assist percentage

`A% = Total team assists / FGM * 100`

**3PA%**: a team's/opp.'s 3-point attempt percentage

`3PA% = 3PA / FGA * 100`

**FT \(point distribution\)**: percentage of points from made free throws

`FT = FTM / TP * 100`

**2P \(point distribution\)**: percentage of points from made 2-point shots

`2P = 2P / TP * 100`

**3P \(point distribution\)**: percentage of points from made 3-point shots

`3P = 3P / TP * 100`

### Personnel Stats

**Height**: total height of a team weighted by minutes played

**Bench Minutes**: the number of minutes a team's bench plays

**Continuity**: minutes played season-to-season

**Experience**: year in school weighted by minutes played

**Defensive Fingerprint**: identifies the style of a team's defense

**2-Foul Participation**: percentage of time a starter with 2 fouls plays in the first half
