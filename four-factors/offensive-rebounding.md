# Offensive Rebounding

A team's ability to increase its number of possessions, gives it a greater chance to score points and win games. Offensive rebounding is the main factor for a team to gain possessions.

This is measured by offensive rebounding percentage or the percentage of offensive rebounds a team grabs over the course of a game or season.

`OR% = Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent's Defensive Rebounds)`

For example, over the entire 2017-2018 season Duke's Offensive Rebounding Percentage was **38.3%**.

The Blue Devils grabbed 486 offensive rebounds to their opponents 783 defensive rebounds.

`OR% = 486 / (486 + 783) = 0.383 * 100`

This means on a Duke missed shot or free throw, the team rebounded the ball **38%** of the time.

### Defensive Rebounding & Made Shots

Similar to how a team forces turnovers, defensive rebounding can limit a team's chance to earn more possessions.

For example, Duke posted a defensive rebounding rate of **30.0%**. The Blue Devils pulled down 1026 defensive rebounds and its opponents snagged 439 offensive rebounds.

Opponents' OR% = 439 / \(439 + 1026\) = .2997 \* 100\)

This means Duke's opponents only grabbed an offensive rebound on **30%** of its misses.

#### How shooting impacts rebounds?

A team's ability to shoot or make shots also impacts offensive rebounding percentage.

For example, in the 2018 NCAA Tournament Semifinal, Villanova grabbed 7 offensive rebounds. Oklahoma State snagged 23 defensive rebounds.

Villanova's OR% was **23%**.

OR% = 7 / \(7 +23\) = .23 \* 100

The Wildcats made 55.4% of their shots explaining their low percentage of offensive rebounds.

### Team Rebounds

Rebounds are measured differently across all of college basketball. [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) and other analytics sites compute percentages that **don't include team rebounds**.

Team rebounds are totaled by specific schools and other entities. This means there can be a slight difference between rebounding totals depending on the source of the box score or statistics.

_What is a team rebound?_

If a team misses a shot, a rebound is recorded. Not every missed shot falls into the possession of an individual player.

For example, a missed shot can go out of bounds. In this situation, a team rebound is given to the team that was defending the missed shot.

This is common if a team shoots an airball, a missed shot goes over the backboard, or 2 or more players from the same team gain possession of the ball.
