# Effective field goal percentage

This stat measures a team's ability to shoot 2-point and 3-point shots.

A team's field goal percentage is calculated by the number of shots attempted divided by the number of shots made. This includes **both** 2-point and 3-point shots.

`FG% = FGM/FGA * 100`

For example, in the 2018 NCAA Tournament Semifinal game between Villanova and Kansas, Villanova made 36 of its 65 shot attempts en route to scoring 95 points.

The Wildcats' field goal percentage was **55.4**%.

`FG% = 36/65 = 0.5538 * 100`

Effective field goal percentage takes into account that a 3-point field goal is worth more than a 2-point field goal.

`eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA * 100`

Villanova made 18 3-point shots and attempted 40 in the game. 18 of their 36 made shots were worth 3 points. And 40 of their 65 shot attempts were 3-pointers.

The Wildcats eFG% was **69.2%** for the game.

`(eFG% = (.5 * 18 + 36) / 65 = 0.6923 * 100)`

### Why this statistic is important

Effective field goal percentage indicates how easily a team scores most of its points. A higher percentage shows a team is efficient at shooting and likely has a chance to win many games.

A team's ability to defend or lower their opponent's eFG% is equally important. If a team can hold their opponent to a lower eFG%, the better chance it has to win.
