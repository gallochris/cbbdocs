# Personnel Stats

A team's personnel can be measured across 5 different categories:

1. **Height**: total height of a team weighted by minutes played
2. **Bench Minutes**: the number of minutes a team's bench plays
3. **Continuity**: minutes played season-to-season
4. **Experience**: year in school weighted by minutes played
5. **Defensive Fingerprint**: identifies the style of a team's defense
6. **2-Foul Participation**: percentage of time a starter with 2 fouls plays in the first half 

Assumptions are made for each of these components, and detailed explanations are below.

### Height

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) calls height is the [most talked about physical trait](http://www.basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=82) in basketball. You can't teach it, right?

It does have a slight correlation to a team's offensive and defensive efficiency. And it makes sense, a taller team might defend well and score at ease in the paint versus a shorter team. But it's not the _only metric_ that matters.

**Average Height**

This is measured by gathering the average listed height of every player on a team, weighted by the minutes played.

It _excludes players that play less than 10% of their team's minutes_.

Syracuse led the country in average height at 80.1 inches in the 2017-2018 season.

The shortest player featured in over 10% of the team's minutes was 6'5 or 75 inches.

**Positional Height**

This can also be broken down into positional height, meaning by each of the 5 positions on the court.

It takes the minutes played for each team ordered by height. For example, 20% of minutes played by the tallest players are likely the center's minutes.

For example, Purdue's average height at the center position was +5.4 inches taller than the average of all teams.

Purdue's starting center, Isaac Haas, was 7'2 or 86 inches, and their backup center, Matt Haarms was 7'3 or 87 inches.

**Effective Height**

Effective height is the average of the center and power forward position. The same Purdue squad posted an effective height of 3 inches for these 2 positions.

### Bench Minutes

Bench minutes, defined by [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/), makes an assumption that the starters of a team are the 5 players that have played the most minutes on the year.

The remaining minutes are assumed to be the bench minutes. If a player has played less than _10% of their team's minutes, the player is excluded_ in the bench minutes.

Alabama's bench played in 36.6% of its minutes in the 2017-2018. That ranked 49th in the country. In 3 of its 5 positions, players shared a large percentage of minutes played.

In contrast, Kansas' bench played in only 20.9% of its minutes. That's 345th amongst all Division-I teams.

Whether a team relies on its bench is more of an attribute than a driving factor of its success. It can certainly be a factor if there is foul trouble, injuries, or a stretch of several games played in a short period.

### Continuity

Continuity is the percentage of a teamâ€™s minutes that are played by the same player or players from last season to this season.

It answers more than are the same players playing this season?

It uses a percentage of a players minutes played because of injuries and a player's increased or decreased minutes season to season.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) takes each player on the current roster, uses the minimum minutes \(on a percentage basis\) he played comparing this season and last season, and then takes the sum for all players.

Let's use the 2015-16 North Carolina team as an example. Below are the minutes from the 2014-2015 season to the 2015-2016 team. The far column includes the minimum value.

```text
Player  |   %Min 14-15  | %Min 15-16  | Min
--------+---------------+-------------+-----+
Paige   |    16.5       |   13.4      | 13.4
Johnson |    12.2       |   14.0      | 12.2
Jackson |    13.3       |   14.1      | 13.3
Hicks   |    7.35       |   9.00      | 7.35
Meeks   |    11.2       |   8.48      | 8.48
Berry   |    5.20       |   15.4      | 5.20
Pinson  |    3.92       |   9.33      | 3.92
Britt   |    7.60       |   7.50      | 7.50
James   |    4.99       |   3.61      | 3.61
Maye    |    0.00       |   2.22      | 0.00
Williams|    0.00       |   1.52      | 0.00
White   |    0.30       |   0.40      | 0.30
Coleman |    0.24       |   0.21      | 0.21
Coker   |    0.00       |   0.20      | 0.00
Dalton  |    0.03       |   0.20      | 0.03
Egbuna  |    0.00       |   0.24      | 0.00
--------+---------------+-------------+-----+
```

The sum of the last column is **75.7**. North Carolina players played around 76% of the minutes from 2014-2015 to 2015-2016 season. That was good for 12th amongst all Division-I teams in the 2015-16 season.

Continuity is a new, and fascinating, stat. It tells more of a story, and as [Kenpom](http://kenpom.com/)describes teams with [better continuity](http://kenpom.com/blog/measuring-continuity/), tend to perform better too.

In a landscape where the best teams often feature players headed to the NBA after one year, continuity is a fun metric to follow.

For example, below is Kentucky's continuity over the last 5 seasons:

```text
Year    |   Continuity  | Division-I Rank |
--------+---------------+----------------+
17-18   |   11.2        |   348
16-17   |   30.2        |   322
15-16   |   22.0        |   335
14-15   |   49.6        |   176
13-14   |   23.6        |   336
--------+---------------+----------------+
```

Kentucky continuity is often low, but it doesn't mean they're not winning games.

### Experience

Experience is another storytelling stat. [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) makes the assumption that a player's eligibility class determines their experience.

Under this assumption, the following class has these levels of experience:

```text
Year       | Experience |
-----------+------------+
Freshmen   |   0        |
Sophomore  |   1        |
Junior     |   2        |
Senior     |   3        |
-----------+------------+
```

Experience uses minutes played similar to the average height calculation. Players that play in _less than 10% of their team's minutes are excluded_.

In the 2017-2018 season, Wichita State ranked 13th in the country with 2.36 years of experience. This squad featured 9 upperclassmen \(seniors and/or juniors\).

For a comparison, Kentucky ranked dead last in the country with 0.18 years of experience.

### Defensive Fingerprint

Does a team play man-to-man? Zone? Both?

The answer can be found in a team's defensive fingerprint. [Kenpom](http://kenpom.com/) uses a variety of stats to breakdown teams into 4 defensive categories:

1. **Mostly man**: team plays mostly man-to-man defense
2. **Inconclusive**: can't identify a specific defensive tendency
3. **Some zone**: team is in zone defense for a good amount of its defensive possessions
4. **Mostly zone**: team plays most its defensive possessions in a zone defense

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) describes defensive fingerprint as raw. It uses assist percentage, 3-point attempt percentage, free throw attempt percentage, turnover percentage, and defensive rebounding percentage.

It weights these stats to develop a profile, and place a team in a certain fingerprint category. For example, zone teams tend to have higher a defensive assist percentage and 3-point attempt percentage.

Syracuse is known for its 2-3 zone. It statistically is near the bottom of all teams in defensive assist percentage and 3-point attempt percentage.

In the 2017-2018 season, Syracuse ranked 351th in defensive A% at 73.8 and 338th in defensive 3PA% at a 44.5% clip.

### 2-Foul Participation 

When a player picks up his second foul in the first half, does he head to the bench? 

2-foul participation attempt to answer this question and reveal more of a coaching philosophy around fouls. The measurement is the percentage of time that a starter with 2 fouls in the first half has been allowed to play as detailed in [this blog post](https://kenpom.com/blog/introducing-2-foul-participation/). 

For example, starters for Virginia played 3.8% of minutes with 2 fouls in the first half in the 2017-18 season. Virginia, and coach Tony Bennett, ranked 331st in the country in this metric. 

{% hint style="info" %}
_Remember when Virginia lost to 16-seed UMBC in the NCAA Tournament?_ Both Isaiah Wilkins and Devon Hall [picked up 2 fouls](https://virginiasports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3540&path=mbball) in the first half, and both exited the game for the remainder of the first half after doing so.
{% endhint %}

KenPom also includes a few other measurements: 

* total amount of time starters have 2 fouls
* total time starters with 2 fouls are on the floor 
* adjusted 2-foul participation: accounts for backcourt players being allowed to play more
* percentage of bench minutes
