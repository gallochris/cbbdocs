# Points Distrubtion

How a team gets its points can be broken down into 3 areas:

1. Free throws: total points on made free throws
2. 2-Point shots: total points on made 2-point shots
3. 3-Point shots: total points on made 3-point shots

This breakdown describes the style of a team and its strengths. Each category can be used to assess a team's offensive and defensive point distribution.

### Offensive Point Distribution

This section shares examples of a team's offensive distribution of points in these 3 categories.

#### Free Throws

`FT = FTM / TP * 100`

Syracuse scored 24.1% of its points from the free throw line in the 2017-2018 season to rank 5th amongst all Division-I teams.

Syracuse scored 594 of its 2466 points from the foul line.

`FT = 594 / 2466 * 100 = 24.1`

Kansas, a 1-seed in the 2018 NCAA Tournament, was 348th in the country gathering 14.3% of its points from the free throw line in the same season.

#### 2-Point Shots

`2P = 2P / TP * 100`

56.7% of Texas A&M's points came from 2-point shots in the 2017-2018 season. That's good for 19th amongst all Division-I teams.

Texas A&M made 746 2-point shots, good for 1492 points out of its 2631 total points.

`2P = 1492 / 2631 * 100 = 56.7%`

In contrast, the 2017-2018 Missouri team scored 40.8% of its points from 2-point shots. That's 349th in the country in the same season.

#### 3-Point Shots

`3P = 3P / TP * 100`

Davidson scored 42.0% of its points from behind the 3-point line in the 2017-2018 season. This percentage was 6th amongst all teams.

The Wildcats made 353 3-points shots or scored 1,059 points of its 2,519 total points from 3-point land.

`3P = 1059 / 2519 * 100 = 42.0%`

And not surprising, the same Davidson team got only 14.6% of its points from the 3-point shot.

**Think of it as a pie, if a team is low in one area of point distribution \(small slice\), it will be high in another area \(big slice\).**

### Defensive Point Distribution

This section shares examples of a team's defensive distribution of points in these 3 categories.

#### Free Throws

`FT = Opp. FT / TP * 100`

Houston's opponents scored 24.3% of their points from the free throw line in the 2017-2018 season. This percentage was 9th in the nation.

The Cougar's opponents scored 552 of its 2271 points from the foul line.

`FT = 552 / 2271 * 100 = 24.3`

Oklahoma's opponents scored 15% of its points from the free throw line. This was 340th amongst all Division-I teams.

Oklahoma didn't put its opponents on the foul line while Houston fouled its opponents early and often.

#### 2-Point Shots

`2P = 2P / TP * 100`

Wisconsin's opponents scored 56.3% of their points from 2-point shots in the 2017-2018 season. That's good for 9th amongst all Division-I teams.

The Badgers opponents made 613 2-point shots, good for 1226 points out of their total 2117 points.

`2P = 1226 / 2117 * 100 = 56.6%`

As a comparison, West Virginia's opponents scored 42.5% of their points from 2-point shots. That's 338th in the country during the same year.

#### 3-Point Shots

`3P = 3P / TP * 100`

North Carolina allowed opponents to score 39.5% of their points from behind the 3-point line in the 2017-2018 season. This was good for 9th in the country.

Tar Heel opponents scored 1071 of their 2711 total points from 3-point shots.

`3P = 1071 / 2711 * 100 = 39.5%`

In contrast, the Marshall allowed its opponents to score just 27.1% of their points from 3-point shots. That was 314th in the nation.
