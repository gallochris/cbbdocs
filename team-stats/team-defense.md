# Team Defense

A team's defense can be evaluated using the same 7 stats:

1. 3P%: opponent's 3-point field goal percentage
2. 2P%: opponent's 2-point field goal percentage
3. FT%: opponent's free throw percentage
4. Blk%: opponent's block percentage
5. St%: opponent's steal percentage
6. A%: opponent's assist percentage
7. 3PA%: opponent's 3-point attempt percentage

### 3P%

A team's defensive 3-point field goal percentage is its opponents' made 3-point shots divided by its opponents' attempted 3-point shots.

`3P% = Opp. 3PM / Opp. 3PA * 100`

Cincinnati's defensive 3P% was 30.9% in the 2017-2018 season, good for 7th amongst all Division-I teams.

Its opponents made 231 3-point shots in 747 attempts.

`3P% = 231 / 747 * 100 = 30.9%`

For a comparison, North Carolina's opponents made 38% of their 3-point shots. That's good for 316th in the country in 2017-2018.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) has [written extensively](http://kenpom.com/blog/3point-defense-should-not-be-defined-by-opponents-3p/) about _why_ a team's 3P% defense should not be defined by its opponent's 3P% offense.

### 2P%

A team's defensive 2-point field goal percentage is calculated by taking its opponents' 2-point makes and dividing them by its opponents' 2-point attempts.

`2P% = Opp. 2PM / Opp. 2PA * 100`

The 2017-18 Michigan State Spartans ranked 1st in the nation limiting opponents' 2P% to 38.4%.

Michigan State opponents made 522 of 1360 2-point shot attempts.

`2P% = 522 / 1360 * 100 = 38.4`

For some contrast, NC State's opponents made 53.6% of its 2-point shots. That clip was 297th amongst all Division-I teams.

While 3P% is not indicative of a team's 3-point defense, 2P% can be attributed some to how a team protects the rim and defends overall.

### FT%

A team's defensive free throw percentage is its opponent's free throw makes divided by its opponents' free throw attempts.

`FT% = FTM / FTA * 100`

BYU opponents made 65.6% of its free throws in the 2017-2018 season. This percentage put the Cougars at 1st in the country.

And in comparison, Xavier opponents made 76.0% of their free throw attempts. This was rated 347th out of all teams in 2017-2018.

Obviously you can't defend free throws. It's an uncontested shot. But if you can limit a team from attempting free throws, it could be a big factor. Can't make them if you don't take them.

### Blk%

Defensive Block percentage is a team's total blocked shots divided by its opponents' 2-point field goal attempts.

`Blk% = Blocked shots / Opp. 2PA * 100`

Syracuse ranked 3rd in the country blocking 17.4% of its opponents' 2-point shot attempts.

The Orange blocked 197 of its opponents' 1136 2-point shot attempts.

`Blk = 197 / 1136 * 100 = 17.4%`

This make sense, as Syracuse limited its opponents to shoot 45.1% for inside the 3-point line.

South Dakota State blocked only 5.6% of its opponents' shots in 2017-2018. This clip ranked 334th in the country.

### Stl%

A team's defensive steals percentage is a team's total number of steals divided by its opponent's offensive possessions.

`Stls% = Total steals / Possessions`

Kansas State posted a 11.9% steals percentage in 2017-2018. This was good for 3rd in the country.

The Wildcats recorded 294 steals in its opponents' estimated 2,480 offensive possessions.

`Stls% = 294 / 2,480 * 100 = 11.9`

In comparison, Georgia's defensive steal percentage was more than half of that at 5.8%. This ranked 349th in the country.

### A%

A team's defensive assist percentage is its opponents' total amount of assists divided by its opponents' made field goals. This includes both 3-point and 2-point makes.

`A% = Opp. assists / Opp. FGM * 100`

Penn ranked 3rd amongst all Division-I teams limiting its opponents to a 39.6% assist percentage. Penn's opponents had 323 assists on 816 made baskets.

`A% = 323 / 816 * 100 = 39.58`

Syracuse opponents registered a 73.8% assist percentage in the 2017-2018 season. This was last \(351st\) amongst all teams.

_Assist percentage sometimes has less do with defense, and more to do with style of play. Syracuse is known for its 2-3 zone, and to beat a zone, you must share the ball._

### 3PA%

A team's defensive 3-point attempt percentage is the percentage of 3-point shots its opponents attempt divided by their opponents' total shot attempts.

`3PA% = Opp. 3PA / Opp. FGA * 100`

Michigan's opponents took 30.2% of their shots from behind the 3-point line in the 2017-2018 season. This was 6th amongst all Division-I teams.

The Wolverines opponents' attempted 222 3-pointers out of 2,226 total shot attempts.

`3PA% = 222 / 2226 * 100 = 30.2`

In contrast, Georgia State's opponents attempted 46.2% of their shots from behind the 3-point line. That's percentage ranked 347th in the country.

**Remember**: Teams have much more control over how many 3-point shots their opponents shoot than how many they make.
